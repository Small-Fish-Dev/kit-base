# Base Kit

### What?

The fundamental systems/abstractions used in our kits.

A "kit" lets you drop something in your project and get started with a type of game right away.

**Examples:**
- FPS Kit
- Vehicle Kit
- Platformer Kit

And they would all be able interact with each other where it makes sense.

### Why?

Games share lots of code, reuse lots of systems.

It'd be alot easier if you didn't waste time reinventing the wheel.

This effort is about allowing you to not do that and just make your game.
